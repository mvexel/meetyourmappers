		Meet Your Mapper (MYM) tells you who has mapped in your area, when, and how much. Use it for fun, curiosity, or to help you make a list of people to  invite to a mapping party or some other OSM event.
		<p>If you are interested in more detail about what other mappers are doing in your area, there are way better tools to do that, like OSMCha, Whodidit and Who's Around Me.
		<h3>About Mapper Types</h3> 
		MYM groups mappers into types based on their mapping history. There are <em>normal mappers</em>, <em>power mappers</em>, and <em>mayfly mappers</em>, and <em>new mappers</em>. If someone has not mapped recently, they are either <em>retired</em> or <em>forgotten</em>.
		<h3>Technical</h3>
		The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/mvexel/meetyourmappers">on Github</a>. It is written in Python using the Flask framework, and Javascript for the front end functionality.
		<p><em>Meet your Mappers was created by <a href="https://ma.rtijn.org/">Martijn van Exel</a></em>.
